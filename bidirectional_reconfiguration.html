<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Owing to the complexity and flexibility of modern industry, a system often has multiple operation modes and the reconfiguration mechanism is often required to be bidirectional. The unidirectional reconfiguration approach for discrete-event systems has been proved to effectively solve one-way reconfiguration problems modeled from real scenarios but fails to handle bidirectional reconfiguration problems. In this report, we study the fundamentals of bidirectional reconfiguration and multiple reconfiguration of discrete-event systems. Specifically, we introduce a bidirectional reconfiguration specification by analyzing states and events in each plant component and extend similar techniques to multiple reconfiguration in both monolithic and localized architectures. The proposed approaches are compatible with supervisory control theory, so the resulting supervisors can regulate both reconfiguration and normal behaviors of the system. Finally, the trigger requirement and guaranteed reachability are studied as notable issues in applications.</p>

<strong>Dressing Up for the Regulators: Evidence from the Largest-Ever Supervisory Review</strong><br>with Puriya Abbassi, Rajkamal Iyer and Jos&eacute;-Luis Peydr&oacute;<br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Government regulation requires effective supervision, but regulated entities may window-dress to supervisors.  For empirical identification, we analyze banks exploiting a quasi-natural experiment —ECB’s 2014 asset quality review (AQR)— in conjunction with the security and credit registers.  After the AQR announcement, reviewed banks decrease the share of riskier securities and loans, and level of overall securities and credit supply. After AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities, but not riskier credit.  Effects are stronger for banks with higher trading expertise.  Results suggest banks’ window-dressing for supervisory audits, especially on liquid securities that are easier to trade, and hold important implications for supervision.</p><br>
