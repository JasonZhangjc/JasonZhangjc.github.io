Welcome! My name is Jiachen (People call me Jason). I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Dpartment of Mechnical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. Previously, I was an M.A.Sc. student in the Dpartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. I graduated from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2017.

My research interests lie in financial economics. I've researched how banks cause credit frictions to the real economy, how they interact with regulators and how their CEOs/CFOs words can be used to proxy the uncertainty banks face. Helping me along the way, I've been learning how to apply recent techniques in machine learning and natural language processing to these economic problems. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://pesoto.github.io/research" target="_self">research</a> and my <a href="https://pesoto.github.io/research" target="_self">tutorials</a> to learn more!
